= Digital Ocean Workspace Setup

This guide provides a step-by-step process for deploying and managing project workspaces (environments) .

== Prerequisites
- Install `doctl`, the official DigitalOcean CLI tool.
- If 1Password CLI is installed, the script will use the op aws plugin to authenticate.
- Create a https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/create-personal-access-token/[personal access token] for authentication.

== Authenticate `doctl` (not required if using 1Password)

To authenticate `doctl` with your personal access token, use the following command:

[code, shell]
----
doctl auth init
----

Follow the prompts to enter your personal access token.

[code, shell]
----
./backend.sh deploy my_project [development|staging|production|...]
----
== Delete

To delete a DigitalOcean workspace, use the command below:

[code, shell]
