= nabu

nabu might become a multiplayer engine for trick taking card games.

For now…​ not much more than an IaC template to deploy:

- A web server
- Containerized Redis and PostgreSQL
- A couple of Rust APIs
- A couple of Rust Background Workers

…​to one or more VMs that can be hosted on:

- AWS
- Azure
- Digital Ocean
- QEMU (locally for development/testing).

...using terraform or opentofu and ansible for infrastructure setup, and ansible for application deployment (just because it can be initiated and used locally).
